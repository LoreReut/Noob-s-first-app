Name:         Mob HP Tracker

Platform:     Android

Description:  Designed for Dungeon Masters to help them follow the HP the mobs have. It's a simple app which will let me               create a mob (name & HP), move it around the screen and substract HP from it.

To do list:


 * [x] Let me print on the main activity the name & max HP of a monster.
 * [x] Let the monsters be draggable.
 * [x] Let the HP be editable
 * [x] Let each mob and its HP be saveable for future use.
